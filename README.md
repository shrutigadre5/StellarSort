# StellarSort

This notebook is designed as a short tour of statistical learning covering both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. We will apply well-known ML algorithms on two astronomical datasets representative of the most common usecases: mining of tabular data and image processing.

This tutorial uses Python and its scientific computing ecosystem (e.g. NumPy, SciPy, pandasâ€¦).

Objectives:

* a tutorial on astro-oriented ML packages (such as astropy, astroML or astroNN),
* a comprehensive demonstration of scikit-learn or PyTorch,
* a machine learning class.
Rather, this hands-on tutorial is designed to be a progressive introduction to machine learning concepts and algorithms illustrated by code examples on real-world datasets. We will mostly focus on supervised techniques for classification, which are the most common.
